Subject: Updated timeline for deliverable

Hi Anthony,

Thanks—quick update. To deliver a client-ready solution (not just a pass/fail check), I’ll need the rest of the week and will send the full package by EOD Friday (Feb 6).

What I’m building:
- End-to-end workflow (ingestion → validation → outputs) with repeatable runs
- Core logic + edge-case handling with tests and sanity checks
- Deliverable layer: docs, a runnable entry point, and a short walkthrough

If you’d prefer an interim pass/fail version sooner, I can send that ahead of the full deliverable—just let me know.

Best regards,  
RH
